# balena-DonkeyCar-Virtual

A virtual build of a DonkeyCar on a RaspberryPi 4, containerized for balena. No physical hardware needed, just connect to a hosted Simulator.

## Intro

This repo installs the popular DonkeyCar autonomous vehicle / self-driving bot platform into a container, ready to be deployed on a balena device like a Raspberry Pi.

There are several components to cover:
- Hardware
- Software
- Using the Container

Also keep in mind that this Readme only covers the Balena-specific bits, but the proper DonkeyCar documentation covers many more topics, and in much greater detail.

## TO-DO - Documentation
## Hardware
## Software
## Using the Container
